# Chi-square-test

### Background:
Mizzare Corporation has collected data on customer satisfaction levels for two types of smart home devices: Smart Thermostats and Smart Lights. They want to determine if there's a significant association between the type of device purchased and the customer's satisfaction level.
### Data Provided:
#### The data is summarized in a contingency table showing the counts of customers in each satisfaction level for both types of devices:
Satisfaction	Smart Thermostat	Smart Light	Total
Very Satisfied	50	70	
Satisfied	80	100	
Neutral	60	90
Unsatisfied	30	50
Very Unsatisfied	20	50
Total	240	360
### Objective:
To use the Chi-Square test for independence to determine if there's a significant association between the type of smart home device purchased (Smart Thermostats vs. Smart Lights) and the customer satisfaction level.
#### Assignment Tasks:
1. State the Hypotheses:
2. Compute the Chi-Square Statistic:
3. Determine the Critical Value:
Using the significance level (alpha) of 0.05 and the degrees of freedom (which is the number of categories minus 1)
4. Make a Decision:
Compare the Chi-Square statistic with the critical value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
